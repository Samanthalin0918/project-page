## Abstract
![Picture of Chenly Insights](static/chenly_landing_page.png) \
The objective of our product, Chenly Insights, is to help users combat misinformation using factual factors and microfactors. As misinformation gets easier to spread due to deep fakes and large social networks, this project empowers users by giving them a veracity (truthness) for the news they receive through a Mesop interface. A user will link and upload a news article of their choice. Then, two different types of AI, generative and predictive, judge the article on appropriate factuality factors. The scores are accumulated and then shown to the user, along with other visualizations related to the article. In addition, these scores, along with metadata related to the article, will be uploaded to a vector database that generative AI can use. This vector database is constantly updated with new information from fact check and news websites. Users can also converse with the AI and ask questions about each article and why a particular score was given. We also found the best prompting types with adjustments to the prompts that gives the highest accuracy.

## Dataset
We utilized multiple different data sources to both establish the ground truth and understand factors that indicate misinformation. Generally, the more context and information you give a large language model, it can give more nuanced and thoughtful judgements on a piece of text. The data is as follows: 
* **Liar Plus Dataset**: A publicly available dataset containing labeled statements from news sources with contextual information. After preprocessing, we have a dataset of 10,234 rows and 15 columns, with a key truthness labels **six levels from "pants-on-fire" to "true"**. Primarily used in our vector database and predictive AI training.
* **Politifact Factchecks**: A website that factchecks articles and statements made by leaders. Used to help set the ground truth of a topic.
* **User-Selected PDFs**: Article links or PDFs are analyzed with this engine and assigned a truthness label afterwards.
* **SERP API Search Results**: Google search results based on the title of the user-selected articles to provide the veracity engine with more information.
* **Factuality Factors**: These factors determine the veracity of an article and we analyze four of them for each article: sensationalism, stance detection, social credibility, naive realism.

## Generative AI Methods
**Tool: Google Gemini 1.5 Pro 002**

Where and how we used it:
* Extracting key attributes from the user-uploaded text (e.g., speaker, context, title) to support predictive AI modeling.
* Evaluating sensationalism and political stance via structured prompts.

Prompting techniques and their objectives:
* **Normal prompting**: asking a baseline question for a general response from Gemini given a factuality factor.
* **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: asking the model to explain its response, allowing it to reason to get a more accurate response given a factuality factor.
* **Fractal Chain of Thought (FCoT)**: asks the model to go through iterations to explain its response and reasoning and to check what it missed on its previous iterations, to get a more well-rounded and accurate response given a factuality factor.
  
Additional information we provide to Gemini in our prompts:
* **Serp API**: search for related articles using Serp API, and use this information as a "ground truth" for Gemini to refine its evaluations.
* **RAG via ChromaDB**: Extract top three related saved contents from websites such as Politifact and Snopes by HTML parsing for Gemini to gain extra information on similar topics.

## Predictive AI Methods
**Tools: Python, HuggingFace, XGBoosted Decision Tree, Pandas, PyTorch**

Built and trained different models for different factuality factors
* **Naive Realism**: used Spacy Textblob and a HuggingFace sentiment analysis model to calculate confidence and subjectivity, and trained the model using an XGBoosted Decision Tree.
* **Social Credibility**: Cleaned Liar Plus Dataset, one hot-encoded the speakers, context, and party affiliation, and finally built and trained a neural network model.


## Results
We will be adding more graphs/tables over the next week

## Discussion
In our project, we've attempted to follow previous work's suggestions by combining predictive and generative artificial intelligence in detecting misinformation. We successfully developed a simple hybrid system that scores articles' veracity, and this is a significant step forward in addressing the complex challenge of misinformation in a digital age. 

However, our results should be taken with a grain of salt, as there were issues. Depending on the human graders, the factuality factor score of a particular article could vary wildly. In an ideal world, we would have a commitee of misinformation experts (at least 10 for a good sample size) reading through articles and rating them. This will allow to choose the best prompting styles with proper adjustments in a more confident manner. 

## Future Direction
* Combined Generative AI and Predictive AI for a single factuality factor
* Adjust prompting techniques to help LLMs achieve more human-like scoring
* expanding more data sources to provide for LLMs to utilize

## Data Ethics
**Data**:
* Liar plus dataset proven to have high-quality data according to the UC Berkeley Library.
* Politifact and Snopes are also high-quality data approved by UC Berkeley Library
* That being said, we're confident that the data used within our project creation process is ethical and accurate.

**System**:
* our system will not always provide the most accurate representation of the veracity.
* we will mention in our system to warn the users about the information and scores they get from our system will not be 100\% correct.
* Users should only use the results as a piece of information in addition to their judgment.
